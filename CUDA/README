This folder contains a variety of programs testing operations on the Tegra X2 GPU with CUDA. To complie a CUDA program use the nvcc command. The efficient matrix multiplication program works to improve computation time by reducing global memory access with shared memory between threads in a single block. It acks to have each block utilize its threads to compute a sub matrix of the final matrix multiplication result.
